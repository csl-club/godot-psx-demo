# godot-psx-demo
A Demo of a PSX-Style Godot game!

Check it out on (itch.io)[https://oczi.itch.io/godot-psx-demo]!

# TODO
- Fix web build: camera is bugged and click is not detected as well
- Add church textures
- Maybe some terrain brush
- And maybe add tree collision shapes (auto generating with MeshInstance is broken)
